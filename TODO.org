* TODO Cock-within-cock
  In other words, what if you're writing docs for an element and want
  to insert e.g. source-code in the description? Ouch; we need
  recursive pre-post-order. Unless, of course, the markdown-subset
  suffices.

  Yeah, let's do markdown with multi-line docs.
* TODO Minimum required for self-documentation
  At the very least, let's have a =@(source ...)= directive; we could
  have =@(text ...)=, too, but we're going to fill it with
  wiki-specific crap.

  I'm yearning for =@(example ...)=.
* TODO Post-to-web
  Can we do it directly over svn; or do we need to use the
  web-interface to the wiki, somehow?
* TODO Setup-helper for documentation
  Should degrade gracefully if e.g. =cock= is not installed.

* TODO Modules
  The modules themselves have docs? Shit. That's a lot of source-code.

  You know what, though? We can't do this, I believe as long as we
  rely on the reader: the reader will have finished parsing the thing
  before we can backtrack and read the contained expressions.

  We'd have to parse the file ourselves, looking for e.g. =doc=-forms;
  unless, of course, we did a dirty hack and read the embedded
  expressions in through a string port.

  At that point, though, why aren't we just parsing the god-damn
  thing?

  Interesting things to do with modules: list of exports; oh, shit:
  should the exports link to the docs? We have a table of contents;
  but, yeah: maybe. We'd have to check which objects we have
  documentation for.

  Could we do a table and pluck a description from the docs?

  Can't do the string-port hack, by the way; since, by the time we see
  the expressions, the docs have been stripped. We do have parsed
  docexprs inside of the module; good luck, however, determining which
  expressions they're associated with.

  Yeah: to descend into modules, we're going to have to parse the
  source. =@= has some preëxisting reader that maps it to =#f=, but we
  can disable that.

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (use debug miscmacros ports test)
    
    (test
     '((test) @)
     (with-input-from-string

              (expressions '() (cons expression expressions)))
             ((eof-object? expression) expressions)))))
  #+END_SRC

  Turns out we don't need to disable it. Real modules have to wait for
  a /bona fide/ parser. How difficult would that be, btw? Scan for
  =@=, keeping track of parents; don't descend into
  lists-following-=@=; ignore symbols. =@= tokenizes itself.
