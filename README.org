* Abstract
  =Cock= provides in-source documentation for Chicken scheme; it
  currently targets PDF-over-LaTeX, but we'd like to add svnwiki and
  maybe HTML.
* Using =cock=
  =Cock= uses reader macros, which work out-of-the-box in interpreted
  code; this should suffice for interpreted code:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (use cock)
  #+END_SRC
  #+END_QUOTE

  Compiled code, on the other hand, requires passing an option to the
  compiler in addition to the =use= statement:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    -X cock
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  #+END_QUOTE

  This issue with using reader-macros in compiled code is documented
  [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/4/faq#why-does-define-reader-ctornot-work-in-my-compiled-program][here]] and [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/man/4/faq#why-does-define-reader-ctornot-work-in-my-compiled-program][here]].
